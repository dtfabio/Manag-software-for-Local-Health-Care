<h2><b>Management software for Local Health Care in Cardiff</b></h2>

The Cardiff LHC needs a program to assign primary care physicians to patients living in the city of Cardiff.

Specifically, the program must provide the following features:
  
  1. Inserting a new doctor. The function takes as input the surname, first name and serial number of a new doctor and
  inserts the doctor in the archive.
  
  2. Insertion of a new patient. The function takes as input the surname, the name and the National Insurance Number of a
  new patient and inserts the patient in the archive.
  
  3. Doctor to patient assignment. The function takes as input the doctor's serial number and the patient's National
  Insurance Number. The program displays the surname and first name of the doctor and the surname and first name of the
  patient and asks the user for confirmation of the data entered. If the user confirms the data entered, the patient is
  assigned to the doctor. Note that each doctor cannot have more than a certain number of patients fixed in advance (which
  is 500 for the Cardiff LHC).
  
  4. Viewing doctors. The feature displays the list of all doctors belonging to the Cardiff LHC.
  
  5. Patient record display. The function takes the patient's National Insurance Number as an input and displays the
  patient's data (surname and name) and the data of his general practitioner (surname and name).
